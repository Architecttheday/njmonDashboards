# njmonDashboards

Here is the place to share some Grafana dashboards.

There is a cool tool named njmon to gather performance data from AIX and Linux systems. You can find more information here: http://nmon.sourceforge.net/pmwiki.php?n=Site.Njmon

If you decide to
* Gather data on AIX (incl. VIOS) or Linux with njmon
* Store the data in influxdb
* Visualize the data with Grafana

Then you can find here some nice dashbords to visualize the data.
