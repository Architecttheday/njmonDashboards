# njmonDashboards

Here is the place to share some Grafana Dashboards.
Based on the work of Nigel Griffiths, documented here: http://nmon.sourceforge.net/pmwiki.php?n=Site.Njmon

If you
* Gather data on AIX (incl. VIOS) or Linux with njmon
* Store the data in influxdb
* Visualize the data with Grafana

Then you can find here some nice dashbords to visualize tha data.
